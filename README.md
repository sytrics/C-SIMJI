# C-SIMJI

The goal of the project is to implement an ISS in C, and to create an assembly program in python to translate instructions into binary. It's a school project for ENSTA bretagne.

I took for inspiration the VMinC tutorial here : https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Creating_a_Virtual_Machine/Register_VM_in_C
